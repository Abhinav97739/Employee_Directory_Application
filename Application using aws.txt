Building an app using AWS
App name:- Employee Directory using the services of AWS 
Now it will be build from scratch 
1. Firstly i have created role using IAM roles
   Roles assigned are S3 full access and dynamodb full access and named it:- EmployeeWebapprole
2. Then i created a user named EC2 user and assigned that with Full EC2 policies 
   grouped that user with a group that created at that time named EC2Admins and assigned 
   that group a policy known EC2Full access because its best practice to assign policy 
   to group directly not to assign every particular user.
3. Launched an instance named Employee_Application assigning them Basic necessaties like VPC, Key_pair for ssh
   Cpu etc. Then Provided with the codein usertext at time of creating the instance
   #!/bin/bash -ex
   wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/DEV-AWS-MO-GCNv2/FlaskApp.zip
   unzip FlaskApp.zip
   cd FlaskApp/
   yum -y install python3-pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   yum -y install stress
   export PHOTOS_BUCKET=kauserbucket
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
   export DYNAMO_MODE=on
   FLASK_APP=application.py /usr/local/bin/flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80

4. After this created the VPC particulary for that application only i.e. customized VPC built from the console
   Then created 2 subnets i.e. public subnet and private subnet for the application
    Created a Internet gateway for the VPC to communicate and attach it to the VPC
